This is a brief fullstack project I did for a job app

I intend to add some more protections. I want to validate admin status for admin calls,
encrypt the rest of the personal data for storage in the DB,
and do some more research as to best practices for protecting the path from client to server, 
the path from server to DB,
and the data at rest in the server and DB
